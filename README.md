Solver for the Math 24 game

This repository holds the source code for both the math24 and math24cli ruby gems.

math24 is the base gem, which implements the solver. math24cli is a command line interface to allow a user to interact with the math24 solver via the command line.

Installing the math24cli gem should automatically install the math24 gem.

For more information see:

[math24cli at rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/math24cli)

*NOTE* This does not include a playable version of the math 24 game. That is coming shortly...
